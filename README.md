# Data Science Portfolio

### Aim: 
The aim of portfolio is to represent my accomplishment with Data Science technique and how it benefited the business models, exhibiting the difference in the business model before and after implementing these techniques. 

 
### Business Case Studies:
* Project name: Clear TPA
* Problem Statement: Find pre-authorization needs to be got from which TPA based on historical data. In pre-authorization business, healthcare doctors need to get pre-authorization/permission before performing certain medical services such as Mri, Ct scan, PET scan etc from a TPA chosen by patientsâ€™ health insurance.
* Agents who are working on behalf of doctors have to call the health insurance companies to find out how is the tpa for pre-authorization and then they call the tpa to place pre-authorization request. In this process, agents spent at least 10 mins per pre-authorization request to find out which tpa to call. But if we can find out which tpa to call, then it can significantly improve labour hours by 10 mins for each agent where there are 150 agents works .
